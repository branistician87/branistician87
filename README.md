## Hi there, I'm Brandon Keck! 👋

I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Data Science at CSU East Bay, with an expected graduation in May 2026. I'm focused on enhancing my data science skills, particularly in SQL, Tableau, and Power BI. I'm also strengthening my expertise in databases and analytical tools by working with MySQL and creating data visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau, and Power BI. In the realm of machine learning, I'm exploring various techniques, including regression, clustering, decision trees, and random forests.🚀
